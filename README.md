This repository documents my learning journey in **JavaScript**, focusing on **test automation for Quality Assurance (QA)**.  
It serves both as a study portfolio and as a guide for anyone starting in QA with a focus on frontend automation. 🚀

## ▶️ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PedroAraujoBOliveira/javascript-para-qa.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd javascript-para-qa
   ```

3. **Choose the folder corresponding to the topic you want to study:**
   ```bash
   cd 4-arrays-e-objetos
   ```

4. **To view the content:**
   - If it's an `.html` file, open it directly in your browser (double-click or drag the file into your browser).
   - If it's a `.js` file, run it in the terminal using Node.js:
     ```bash
     node file-name.js
     ```

5. **If you don't have Node.js installed:**
   - Visit [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) and install it to be able to run `.js` files locally.

**Tip:** Use Visual Studio Code to make it easier to navigate and edit the files.

## 📌 Goal

Consolidate the essential JavaScript fundamentals for QA automation, laying the groundwork for tools like Cypress, Playwright, Selenium, among others.
